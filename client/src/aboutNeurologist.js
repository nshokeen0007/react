      <h1>About Neurologists</h1>
      <p>
        Neurologists are medical professionals who specialize in the diagnosis
        and treatment of disorders related to the nervous system. This includes
        the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neurologists play a crucial role in treating conditions such as
        epilepsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's
        disease, and various neurological disorders. They use a combination of
        clinical evaluation, diagnostic tests, and medical treatments to help
        patients manage these conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, neurologists may work with other healthcare professionals
        such as neurosurgeons, physical therapists, and occupational therapists
        to provide comprehensive care for patients with neurological issues.
