      <h1>About Orthopedics</h1>
      <p>
        Orthopedics is a medical specialty that focuses on the diagnosis,
        treatment, and prevention of conditions and injuries related to the
        musculoskeletal system. This system includes bones, joints, muscles,
        ligaments, tendons, and other connective tissues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Orthopedic doctors, also known as orthopedic surgeons, are trained to
        provide both non-surgical and surgical treatment options for a wide
        range of orthopedic issues. They treat conditions such as fractures,
        arthritis, sports injuries, and spinal disorders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Orthopedic surgeons may perform surgeries like joint replacements,
        arthroscopy, and spinal surgeries to help patients regain mobility and
        alleviate pain. They work closely with patients to develop personalized
        treatment plans to improve their musculoskeletal health.
