      <h1>About Cardiology</h1>
      <p>
        Cardiology is a branch of medicine that deals with the study and
        treatment of heart-related diseases and conditions. Cardiologists are
        medical professionals specializing in the diagnosis, prevention, and
        treatment of heart diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some common areas of focus in cardiology include coronary artery
        disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and congenital heart defects. The
        field of cardiology has seen significant advancements in diagnostics and
        treatment options, such as angiography, stent placement, and cardiac
        surgeries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cardiologists work closely with patients to assess their heart health,
        provide recommendations for a healthy lifestyle, and prescribe
        medications or procedures when necessary. Regular check-ups with a
        cardiologist can help prevent and manage heart diseases.
